* Introduction

** What is ascii-phonons?

   - A code to provide publication-quality visualisations of phonon modes
   - Started life as a few scripts
   - Aiming to make nice rendered images available to *ab initio*
     lattice dynamics community

** Key features

   - Static images

   #+REVEAL: split

   - Off-gamma modes

   - Crystallographer-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI)

   - Hacker-friendly Command-line interface (CLI) *[blend\under{}ascii.py]* and Python module *[ascii\under{}phonons]*

   - Blender-artist-friendly Blender Python module *[vsim2blender]*

* Components

** Overview

   [[./images/ascii-phonons-structure.svg]]

** v\under{}sim .ascii file

   - [[http://inac.cea.fr/L_Sim/V_Sim][v\under{}sim]] is a program for interactive visualisation of phonon modes
   - It has a very nice feature set for exploring these
   - No output rendering options
   - Simple, well-defined file format
   - A bit buggy especially with USB monitor adapters, in virtual machines etc.
     - This is likely related to its extensive use of OpenGL. VESTA has similar issues.

** Blender

   - [[https://www.blender.org][Blender]] is the leading open-source package for 3D modelling and animation
     - Codebase inherited from a commercial project, now run by a non-profit
     - Regular [[http://archive.blender.org/features-gallery/blender-open-projects/index.html][open-source film projects]] help drive development forwards

   #+REVEAL: split

   - Blender has a scripting interface which uses a full-blown Python 3 engine, distributed with Blender
   - The hooks are discoverable as tooltips within the desktop interface

   [[./images/tooltip.png]]

** Python interface

   - Building Blender as a module and calling it from your own programs is /hard/
   - Instead, *ascii-phonons* generates throwaway script files with the user requirements and passes them to Blender
   - The most "Blenderish" solution is to make a nice control panel within Blender
   - But Blender has a steep learning curve, creating an unnecessary barrier to use

** Graphical user interface

   - The GUI uses standard Python modules
     - Tkinter "look" is platform-dependent and a bit dated
     - Preview window uses PIL
   - All core functionality is available, the GUI is not "dumbed down"

* Details

** .ascii import
   - Lattice vectors
   - q-points

** Animated atom trajectories
   - Mathematics is adapted from Martin Dove's [[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=isbn%3A0521398940][Introduction to Lattice Dynamics]] 
   $$ \mathbf{r^\prime}(jl,t,\nu) = \\ \mathbf{r}(jl) + \mathbf{U}(j,\mathbf{q},\nu) \exp(i[\mathbf{q r}(jl) - \omega (\mathbf{k},\nu) t]) $$
   - Need to track both atom index $j$ and cell within supercell $l$.
   - Implementation very simple using complex datatypes:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   for frame in range(start_frame, end_frame+1):
       bpy.context.scene.frame_set(frame)
       exponent = cmath.exp( complex(0,1) * 
                      (r.dot(qpt) - 2 * math.pi*frame/n_frames))
       atom.location = r + mass**-.5 * magnitude * 
                           Vector([x.real for x in 
                                   [x * exponent for x in displacement_vector]])
       atom.keyframe_insert(data_path="location",index=-1)
   #+END_SRC

** Arrows
   - Arrow model imported from a file

     #+BEGIN_SRC python
     bpy.ops.wm.link(directory=os.path.dirname(__file__) +
            '/arrow_cylinder.blend/Object/', 
            filepath="arrow_cylinder.blend",  filename="Arrow")
     #+END_SRC
     
   - Blender prefers to specify rotation in Euler notation:
     - rotation about $x$, followed by $y$, followed by $z$
     - Getting this right is harder than it looks!
   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2][atan2]] function is the key
     - Deals with correct intepretation of sign changes

** GUI development
   - Pack vs Grid

* Documentation with Sphinx

https://ascii-phonons.readthedocs.org

** Sphinx --- the good

   - Developed for Python language docs
     - Can handle multiple human and computer languages
   - Generates API documentation from Python docstrings
   - Build the document structure you want
   - Nice templates, customisation also possible
   - Export to HTML, PDF, Epub
   - Popular → Familiar → Easier to browse under stress
   - https://readthedocs.org will host your documentation online for free
     - Provide an attractive, consistent experience
     - Relies on sponsorship; currently their hosting is donated by Rackspace

** Sphinx --- the bad

   - Languages other than Python are an afterthought
     - C, C++, Javascript are built-in
     - [[https://github.com/VACUMM/sphinx-fortran][Fortran]], [[https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaDoc][Julia]], [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain/][Matlab]] extensions developed by third-parties
   - Not as automatic as one would hope
     - In practice you need to create a page for each submodule manually
   - Format for doc pages is Restructured Text (ReST)
     - Can export to this from other formats using [[http://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]]
     - A bridge for Markdown, [[https://recommonmark.readthedocs.org][recommonmark]], also exists
       - [[http://blog.readthedocs.com/adding-markdown-support/][RTD supports it]]
       - Not all features are available, e.g. TOCs

** Sphinx --- the ugly

   - API generation relies on docstrings written in ReST format

   - As well as being unfamiliar, many people consider the readability to be poor

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   def init_material(symbol, col=False, shadeless=True):
       """
       Create material if non-existent. Assign a random colour if none is specified.

       :param col: RGB color. If False, use a random colour.
       :type col: 3-tuple, list or Boolean False
       :param shadeless: Enable set_shadeless material parameter. Informally known as "lights out".
       :type shadeless: Boolean

       :returns: bpy material object
       """
    #+END_SRC

    - Workarounds
      - Keep your beautiful sphinx docs open and use them instead of the docstrings
      - Use the Google or Numpy style with [[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html#google-vs-numpy][Napoleon]]
        - I haven't tried this yet. Could be finnicky?

** Sphinx --- the verdict

   Use it!

* Closing observations

  - Packaging is awkward
    - Automated tools exist, but they can't handle the weird double codebase of this project
